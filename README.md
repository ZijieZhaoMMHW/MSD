MSD
==================================================================

Different from normal rainy condition in northern hemisphere (Hastenrath, 1967), the climatological and annual precipitation over Central America and Mexico are widely dominated by a biomodal precipitation, shaped by two peaks separately during May to July and August to October and a relative trough during between this two peaks, named as midsummer drought (MSD) (Mosiño and García, 1966; Coen, 1973). This phenomenon has been identified and studied for a long time but there are still many unresolved problems around it, includng both mechanism and characteristics. This could be caused by many reasons including the absence of a practical protocol to identify and detect MSD signals. 

Based on a preprint (Zhao et al., in prep.), a new approach to determine and quantify the climatological and annual MSD signals is proposed. This algorithm makes it possible to use annual daily precipitation data to find potential traditionally-defined (where first peak in May to Jul and second peak in Aug to Oct) MSD events. It also specifies MSD signals into daily resolution, enabling more detailed analysis to be applied to MSD events. 

This module contains a set of function associated with detection and analysis about MSD based on recent and past research. This module is built in a user-friendly way and has
