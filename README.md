MSD
==================================================================

Different from normal rainy condition in northern hemisphere (Hastenrath, 1967), the climatological and annual precipitation over Central America and Mexico are widely dominated by a biomodal precipitation, shaped by two peaks separately during May to July and August to October and a relative trough during between this two peaks (Mosiño and García, 1966; Coen, 1973). This phenomenon has been identified and studied for a long time but there are still many unresolved problems around it, includng both mechanism and characteristics. This could be caused by many reasons including the absence of a practical protocol to identify and detect MSD signals. 

In past research, some approaches to determining MSD events have been proposed. Many research paying attention to the mechanism and dynamical of biomodal precipitation over this region tended to use emp
